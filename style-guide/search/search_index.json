Note This document is a work in progress! Guidelines Keep it short. Articles between 300-400 words are easy to read and support the user's workflow. Shorter articles are OK, but articles beyond 500 words are not. If necessary, split the information into different articles. Each paragraph has a single purpose and describes a single concept. Avoid mixing concepts in the same paragraph or repeating the same information in different sections. When there is more than one way to do something or describe something, use the most straightforward way only. Don't discuss all the possible ways. Use admonitions selectively and strategically. Documents with multiple admonitions are harder to read. Add the information as a regular sentence if you use more than three admonitions in your document. Types of documents Status user documentation topics fall into one of these categories: Concept : help me to understand Procedure : help me to do Reference : help me to remember Guide : help me to do multiple related tasks. Note A guide consists of two or more procedures in a single document. Concept: help me to understand Concept articles describe a product's functionality. They complete procedures and provide non-procedural information. A user minting an NFT, for example, may not be interested in understanding the interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. For this user, explaining how to mint an NFT is sufficient. Others, however, may wish to understand this process in more detail, so a concept article on minting NFTs satisfies their curiosity. Status documentation aims to guide users in completing tasks and motivate them to explore the different features and functionalities. Therefore, concepts topics are not as common as procedural topics. A list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) falls under the concept category.

Check out some of the concepts in the Status Help website to get a better sense of how to create content. Procedure: help me do A procedure describes how to complete an action using a series of steps. Procedures help users to use and discover the Status app and are the core of our documentation. These are the main characteristics of procedures in Status documentation: Procedures are split into two different parts. The first part (on top) includes reference (non-procedural) information, while the second part includes procedural information. Non-procedural descriptions must be short and to the point. If the functionality requires further discussion, use an additional concept article . A procedure explains a single task and, if necessary, additional subtasks. If the task is complex, consider splitting it into different procedures and, optionally group them into a guide . For tasks that may cause an error (like, for example, changing a password, choosing a user name, or sending crypto) consider adding a Common questions section at the end of the article, with answers to the most common issues. If the list of possible errors for a specific task is too long, use a FAQ (concept) article instead.

Don't use the -ing form of the verb. Usage Example Correct Delete a group conversation Incorrect Deleting a group conversation Correct Add new members to your Community Incorrect Adding new members to your Community A title should contain the name of the action and how or where the action occurs. Avoid using titles with one or two words. Usage Example Correct Configure your notifications settings Incorrect Notifications Incorrect Notification settings Correct Invite new members to your Community Incorrect Invite new members Be specific on the task's goal and, if possible, avoid empty verbs like make , manage , or put . Usage Example Correct Administer your Status Community tokens Incorrect Manage your Status Community tokens Correct Create an NFT for your Community Incorrect Make an NFT for your Community Writing tasks On the first step, tell the user where to start. Follow the UI elements guidelines to describe the user interactions. Note For clarity purposes, the UI elements on these examples use a regular typeface. Use words consistently when describing user actions. For example, if you use remove in one step, don't use clear , empty or another synonym in a different step. Don't describe to users what's happening on the screen, unless the result is unexpected. Usage Example Correct 1. Click Change. 2. On the Options dialog, uncheck the Automatic box. Incorrect 1. Click Change. A new Options dialog opens. 2. On this dialog, uncheck the Automatic box. Use one step for each user action. It's OK to combine simple actions into a single step. Limit the procedure to a maximum of six steps. If you need more steps to explain the task, split the steps into a subtask. Don't use sublists inside lists; instead, use a new list on a subtask. When certain action occurs in a specific menu or area in the user interface, write the location before the action. Usage Example Correct From the Status Settings, change your profile picture. Incorrect Change your profile picture in the Status Settings. Correct In Available tokens, tap Change token. Incorrect Tap Change token in the Available tokens menu. Write the result of the action first and then, the condition for the result. Usage Example Correct You can see the blue badge after you successfully complete mutual authentication. Incorrect After you complete mutual authentication, you can see the blue badge. Correct To remove the user from your contact list, tap Block user. Incorrect Tap Block user to remove the user from your contact list. Don't use links within a task, except when you need to reference a related subtask in the same article. Reference: help me remember Reference articles provide data that supports users as they perform a task. A reference article can be related to a procedure or work independently. Examples of reference topics are: A list of parameters A list of shortcuts Configuration settings Reference structure Because of its nature, reference topics are mostly based on lists and tables.

Use meaningful titles that provide a precise idea of the article's content. Usage Example Correct Remove someone from a Community channel Incorrect Remove someone Incorrect Removing someone from a Community Correct Browse people and Communities in Status Incorrect Browsing people Incorrect Browsing people and Communities Adhere to the capitalization convention described in this article. For the Markdown file name, use the article's title, all in lowercase letters. Use a dash symbol (\"-\") to replace spaces. Example: Article name: Download Status for Mac Markdown file name: download-status-for-mac.md At the index page level, use a bold typeface to stress the action or concept in the document. Usage Example Correct Add new members to your Community Incorrect Add new members to your Community Incorrect Add new members to your Community Correct About your crypto wallet seed phrase Incorrect About your crypto wallet seed phrase Sentences and paragraphs Write sentences of a maximum of 25 words and paragraphs with a maximum of 5 lines.

Use the Oxford comma for and and or conjunctions. Use these guidelines for periods: Use a period at the end of a sentence, including sentences ending on a URL . Observe the punctuation rules for items on a bullet list . Don't use semicolons (;). Instead, use a period (.) and write the text in a new sentence. Don't use dashes ( em or en dashes.) Use parenthesis if you need to clarify information. On a list with definitions, don't use colons after each item and type the item definition on a new line. For a list with more than three items, use a table . Never use bold or italics with punctuation symbols. Usage Example Correct - Blue badge The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully. - Red badge The user is not a verified contact. Correct - Blue badge : The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully. - Red badge : The user is not a verified contact. Incorrect - Blue badge : The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully. - Red badge : The user is not a verified contact. Incorrect - Blue badge - The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully. - Red badge - The user is not a verified contact. Bullet lists Use a bullet list to improve the readability of sentences or paragraphs where you list or describe three or more items. Usage Example Correct You can find four different types of contacts in your contact list: - Trusted - Verified - Pending verification - Blocked Incorrect You can find four different types of contacts in your contact lists: trusted, verified, pending verification, and blocked. Incorrect You can find trusted, verified, pending verification, and blocked contacts on your contact list. Use a colon (:) before the bullet list items. Punctuation on a bullet list can be tricky. Use the following guidelines: When the list items are complete sentences, use a period at the end of each item. When the list items are not complete sentences or sentences with three words or less, don't use a period. In a list with elements of more and less than three words mixed, don't use a period. When you need to describe each element on a list, consider using a table instead. Tables Tables provide a simple way to summarize information. Use a table instead of bullet lists with more than three items. Bullet list example (incorrect): There are four types of items: Item 1 Item 1 description Item 2 Item 2 description Item 3 Item 3 description Item 4 Item 4 description Table format example ( correct ): There are four types of items: Item Description Item 1 Item 1 description Item 2 Item 2 description Item 3 Item 3 description Item 4 Item 4 description Numbers, date and time, currencies, and units of measure In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater. For decimals, begin with a zero and use the dot (.) as the decimal point. Don't spell out decimals. Usage Example Correct 20.23 Correct 0.13 Incorrect 0,13 Incorrect 0'13 Don't use thousand separators. While a thousand separator improves readability (especially for very long numbers), their symbol and placement vary among countries. Usage Example Correct 2500 Incorrect 2,500 Correct 12500 Incorrect 12.500 Correct 118000 Incorrect 118'000 Don't use rd. or th. to indicate the order of things. Usage Example Correct Select the options in rows 3 and 5. Incorrect Select the 3 rd . and 5 th . options. Different countries use different ways of writing days as numerals. Write out the date to avoid confusion. Usage Example Correct The latest version was released on May 6, 2023. Incorrect The latest version was released on 05/06/23. Incorrect The latest version was released on the 6 th . of May, 2023 For writing decades, use two-digit numbers with an apostrophe (') before and the s letter after them (for example, '90s ). To describe a time, use the 12-hour clock with lowercase a.m./p.m. notation after the time. Usage Example Correct 1 p.m. Incorrect 13 h. Incorrect 1pm Incorrect 1 PM For cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or DeFi tokens, use the symbol described on their website or use the symbol from CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko websites. To write a crypto amount, place the symbol after the number. To write fiat, use the ISO4217 currency symbol after the amount. If you're using fiat to illustrate a concept, use commonly-known currencies like the USA dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), or Japanese yen (JPY). For units of measure, use the metric system . Links Use links to refer to other articles in the Status documentation, but don't abuse them. Don't make the text look like a Wikipedia article with a link on every sentence. Limit the links for sources outside the Status documentation. Don't use links within a task , except when you link to a subtask in the same article. In general, write the link without using the URL. If you must use the URL, omit the https:// and the www parts of the URL (if the website allows this). For links outside of the Status documentation site, use the :octicons-tab-external-16: icon (part of the Material for MkDocs icons bundle ) at the end of the link description. Usage Example Correct Visit status.im/get . Incorrect Visit https://status.im/get . Incorrect Check the \"Safely open apps on your Mac\" article at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 Incorrect Check https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 on the Apple Support website. For external links, add the {:target=\"_blank\"} at the end of the URL to open the link in a new broser tab. Example: For the Mac version, use the [Status website :octicons-tab-external-16:]([https://status.im/get](https://status.im/get)){:target=\"_blank\"} Note To manage URL in the Status documentation, we use a single file per language with all the internal and external links. Refer to the Contributing guide for information about using links in your document. UI elements Note For readability, the examples in other sections don't use these UI elements conventions. UI elements are screen components the user can interact with. A checkbox, a menu, or a button are all UI elements. An explanatory text with no user interaction is not considered a UI element for the purpose of this guide. Write the UI element as seen on the screen, even if it contradicts the style conventions in this guide. Use a bold typeface to write UI elements in procedural steps (1, 2, 3, and so on.) Do not use the bold typeface outside of the procedural steps. Usage Example Correct You can use the Share button to send pictures or documents: 1. Tap Messages . 2. Choose the picture and tap Share . Incorrect You can use the Share button to send pictures or documents: 1. Tap on the Messages button. 2. Choose the picture and tap Share . Don't write the UI control's type (button, drop-down menu, radio button, etc.), except when it isn't clear you're referring to the UI control. Exceptions: pop-up menu, check the [...] box. Usage Example Correct To publish your token, select Publish . Incorrect To publish your token, select the Publish button. Correct On the Permission pop-up menu, tap the Write permission. Incorrect On the Permissions pop-up, tap the Write permission. Incorrect On Permissions , tap the Write permission. Use screen to refer to the current screen in the Status apps. Don't use window , option , or dialog . Usage Example Correct On the Wallet screen, tap New to create a new wallet. Incorrect On the Wallet window, tap New to create a new wallet. Use area to describe a particular group of elements on the current screen. Usage Example Correct On the Contacts screen, select All under the Filter area. Incorrect On the Contacts screen, select All under the Filter section. When you describe a UI interaction, use these action verbs: Element Style convention (desktop, web, and mobile) Menu or screen Use go to . URL For URLs, the verb depends on the user's intent: - To complete another action (for example, to download something), use visit . - To review the information on a different article or website, use check . UI component select (desktop and web) or tap (mobile). Checkbox check the [UI label] box (to select) and uncheck the [UI label] box (to de-select). Screen navigation To move to the previous screen, use return . Element to discard Use swipe [left or right] for desktop, web, and mobile. Select among different elements Use select for desktop, web, and mobile. Use a non-bolded greater-than sign (\">\") to guide users through different screens or options in the app. Usage Example Correct Go to Settings > Messages > Privacy . Incorrect Go to Settings , then go to Messages , then tap Privacy . Admonitions (callouts) Status documentation uses three different types of callouts or admonitions: Admonition Description Tip Information that is not necessary for the task, but it's nice to have. For example, information about a keyboard shortcut. Note Information that is useful to complete the task. This information has no impact on the user's task. Caution Information that has an impact on the user's task. Based on this information, the user may decide to complete or don't complete the task. Don't use warning , error , danger , bug , important , or notes . Don't use admonitions within procedural steps. Observe this rule to place the admonition on your text: In procedures, place the admonition before the procedure (see Writing tasks for more details.) For other content, type the admonition after the content it's referring to. Iconography The Status documentation uses the application icons to guide readers' actions on the app. A document with many icons is harder to follow and scan. Therefore, use icons selectively, and only when it's unclear where to select or tap. If the UI element has a label, write the UI element's label and don't use the icon. Use the Status icons on the /override/.icons/status folder in the GitHub user documentation repository . To reference these icons anywhere on the Markdown file, use the :icon-name: notation right after the name of the icon. For example, the Status wallet icon under the .icons directory is status-wallet.svg ; to show this icon in a sentence, use: Tap Wallet :status-wallet: and save your settings. Modal verbs Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that modify the meaning of the main verb in a sentence. Modal verbs can be problematic in technical communication: Some modal verbs create a sense of uncertainty in readers. Using modal verbs like should or must makes your tone bossier and less helpful. In many cases, using the imperative is a better option. For example: Tone Example Bossy You should save your seed phrase in a secure location. Assertive Save your seed phrase in a secure location. Use this reference for the most frequent modal verbs: Modal verb Usage can Use it to express the possibility of the user to do something, like when you're introducing a new concept or functionality. Example: You can create multiple wallets for different purposes. should Use it selectively to indicate an action that is recommended but optional. must Use it very selectively and only when it's strictly necessary for the user to do something to avoid data or funds loss, data corruption, or unintended information disclosure. could, should, would, might Don't use. Possessive form Use the possessive form with caution and avoid complex possessive forms like the compound possessive . Some non-native English readers may have problems understanding sentences with possessive forms. Usage Example Correct [...] your contact's status. Incorrect [...] your contact's verified status. Correct [...] the verified status of the contact. Correct [...] the picture shared by you and your trusted contact. Incorrect [...] you and your trusted contact's shared picture. If you have to use a passive form with a proper name ending with the possesive s , add the apostrophe at the end without an extra s letter. Usage Example Correct Check your contacts' list. Incorrect Check your contacts's list. If the possessor is not a person, you don't need to add an apostrophe to show possession. Usage Example Correct Verify the contact's ENS name on the Status details screen. Incorrect Verify the contact's ENS name on the Status' details screen. Contractions Use contractions to make your text more casual. Usage Example Use you're / isn't / can't / it's / shouldn't Avoid you are / is not / cannot / it is / should not Avoid the 'd (had or would) and 've (have) contractions, as these may be difficult to understand for non-native speakers. Global writing Don't use idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. When writing examples to make a feature or concept clear, don't use historical references, brand names, social or political events, or any other topic that might be controversial or meaningless for a global audience. Observe the style rules for numbers, date and time, and units of measure . Avoid using they to refer to the neutral gender. While this is a perfectly valid rule in English, it may be difficult to interpret by non-native English speakers. Use left and right carefully. Localized products in LTR languages may have labels on the opposite side. Refer the reader to the specific UI element on the screen instead. Avoid using (s) for plural forms. Usage Example Correct Every file upload requires special permissions. Incorrect The file(s) upload requires special permissions. Correct This option returns each token on your list alphabetically. Incorrect This option returns the token(s) on your list alphabetically. Other style conventions Use everyday language. Don't use jargon, technicalities, flowery or made-up words, or wordy constructions. It's OK to repeat important information through the text. Readers scan the content; they don't read the content. So there are chances they miss this important information. Use gender-neutral language. Don't use he or she, him or her , he or she, or he/she . Instead, use nouns like user , administrator , or content creator . Use the same word for the same concept consistently. Avoid using synonyms to refer to the same idea or feature. Don't use we recommend [...] or Status recommends [...] . Recommendations create doubts in the reader's mind. Instead, explain to users what to do and, if necessary, the consequences of doing or not doing it. Don't use please in technical documentation. Readers look for assertiveness when reading instructions. Don't try to be funny, express emotions with exclamation marks (!), or ask readers rhetorical questions. Users are not interested in reading prose but in getting things done. Usage Example Incorrect Want to personalize and customize your profile for how it appears to other Community members? If so, follow these instructions below! It's OK to use prepositions at the end of sentences (for example, the user you're searching for ). Don't use italics to introduce a new concept and, in general, don't use them on any part of the text (except when writing a UI element that uses italics.) Don't use adjectives to describe the difficulty or time required for a task. Usage Example Incorrect You can easily set up your community. Incorrect Using our app, you can mint your NFTs in no time. Keep phrasal verbs together. Usage Example Correct Execute the command shutdown -h now to shut down the server. Incorrect Execute the command shutdown -h now to shut the server down. Avoid referring to the document itself using On this procedure , In this document , In the following list , In this section , or similar expressions. Use here instead. Usage Example Correct Here you can find the list of keyboard shortcuts. Incorrect In the following section, you can find the list of keyboard shortcuts. Common words usage For spelling differences between British and American English, use the American English variant. Don't use Latin abbreviations like e.g. , etc. or i.e. Use an English equivalent, like for example , and so on , or that is .

We write documentation to help users achieve their goals, overcome roadblocks, and encourage them to explore the Status app. In addition, we provide ways for readers to submit feedback , and we constantly improve our documents based on this feedback. When deciding what to write, we're user-oriented. And when designing documents, we're task-oriented, explaining the main tasks a user can complete on a particular screen or product feature. We describe the tasks a user can perform on the interface; we don't explain the user interface. We work with the Design and UX team to provide users with a modern and consistent experience in our app and documentation. We use the topic and article words indistinctly on this guide. Even though the definition of a topic in technical communication varies based on the methodology or author, this distinction is irrelevant here. Content structure The way we structure and present the information is just as critical as writing it. Users don't read documentation; they scan it. Our approach to content structure supports them on this workflow rather than getting in the way. Many style guides spend considerable time explaining language style and grammar rules. Still, they rarely provide guidelines on applying rules to create easy-to-read and follow documents consistently. Because of this, this style guide offers detailed instructions for structuring your content. We employ a progressive-disclosure approach, providing only the necessary information at the first level (usually, a task or a concept description) while allowing users to explore additional details at subsequent levels (subtasks, cross-links, table of contents, and so forth). We use a topic-based approach based on DITA and well-established information design patterns, where each type of article adheres to a specific structure. However, we don't follow (nor want to follow) a strict DITA approach to documentation. Writing style When creating technical content for Status, consider these guidelines: Write in a friendly, casual, and human tone without sounding bossy, informal, or funny. Write declarative and straightforward prose with short sentences and paragraphs , and use everyday vocabulary. Don't make things any more complicated than they are. Write as you speak. Make every word matter. Avoid words or constructions that make a text harder to read or obfuscate information or the meaning of a sentence. Be precise. Use you or your to address the user. The user and user's goals are at the center of the action, not the software. Don't use cultural or local expressions, made-up words, figurative language, obscure acronyms, metaphors, or (needless to say) discriminatory language. Write for a general audience without considering factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, or gender. Don't assume the reader has prior knowledge of a new concept when introducing it. Instead, explain the idea in simple terms and provide readers with resources or related topics to find out more. We don't obsess over grammar rules. Language isn't an exact science, and different style guides use different conventions. This guide follows the rule commonly accepted, disregarding exceptions. For the English language, the Status documentation follows the English USA writing rules.

We write documentation to help users achieve their goals, overcome roadblocks, and encourage them to explore the Status app. In addition, we provide ways for readers to submit feedback , and we constantly improve our documents based on this feedback. When deciding what to write, we're user-oriented. And when designing documents, we're task-oriented, explaining the main tasks a user can complete on a particular screen or product feature. We describe the tasks a user can perform on the interface; we don't explain the user interface. We work with the Design and UX team to provide users with a modern and consistent experience in our app and documentation. We use the topic and article words indistinctly on this guide. Even though the definition of a topic in technical communication varies based on the methodology or author, this distinction is irrelevant here.","title":"Approach"},{"location":"style-guidelines/#content-structure","text":"The way we structure and present the information is just as critical as writing it. Users don't read documentation; they scan it. Our approach to content structure supports them on this workflow rather than getting in the way. Many style guides spend considerable time explaining language style and grammar rules. Still, they rarely provide guidelines on applying rules to create easy-to-read and follow documents consistently. Because of this, this style guide offers detailed instructions for structuring your content. We employ a progressive-disclosure approach, providing only the necessary information at the first level (usually, a task or a concept description) while allowing users to explore additional details at subsequent levels (subtasks, cross-links, table of contents, and so forth). We use a topic-based approach based on DITA and well-established information design patterns, where each type of article adheres to a specific structure. However, we don't follow (nor want to follow) a strict DITA approach to documentation.","title":"Content structure"},{"location":"style-guidelines/#writing-style","text":"When creating technical content for Status, consider these guidelines: Write in a friendly, casual, and human tone without sounding bossy, informal, or funny.
